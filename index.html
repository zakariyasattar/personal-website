              So, who <i>is</i> Zakariya Sattar? Well, to start, I'm a second year Computer Science student at Michigan State
              University and so far, I've done some amazing things, like building out crazy personal projects, studying Arabic abroad
              in Jordan, and traveling the world (solo) to some insane destinations.
              <br/> <br/>

              I came into high school knowing exactly what I wanted to do. I enrolled in the highest AP
              computer science course I could find (even though I knew nothing about coding) and proceeded to do well,
              impress the professor, and be nominated for president of the App Development Club. Basically the story of my life:
              show up in places I don't belong and do better than everyone else. Sorry if that comes off too strong,
              but it's the truth 	&#128513;.
              <br/><br/>

              From there, it was onto Michigan State University, where I was there for a quick year, before I made the decision
              to spend a year in Jordan, studying Arabic. Thats a story for another time. On return to MSU I joined
              a Network Security Lab and began re-orienting myself with my earliest passion, Computer Science.

              Obviously theres <b> a lot </b> more to talk about, but I don't have enough
              space to talk about it here &#128529;. <a style="color: #7f5af0" href="mailto:zakariyasattar03@gmail.com">Email me</a>
              to schedule an interview.

            &emsp; The idea behind Test-Lock developed after I noticed two things. The first being that javascript has an in-built
            event handler for when the browser exists Full-Screen mode, and the second was that most of the available testing applications
            were desktop applications that were very tricky to use and navigate. The idea was very simple: take the user into
            Full-Screen mode when they start an exam, and when they try to exit Full-Screen mode, give them an alert, warning them
            that if they tried to exit 5 times in total, the exam would be turned in. If the alert was on screen for more than 10 seconds,
            automatically terminate the exam. The user was shown a countdown timer on the alert. This was the largest project I had ever done
            until that point because it required not only implementing this relatively simple front-end feature, but also I had to implement
            proper, secure testing capabilities and an entire functioning back-end for teachers to create and grade tests.
            Due to the scale of the project, I was able to attain deep knowledge of working with JS and HTML to make dynamic webpages and skills in database creation and management.
            I was also forced to learn how to store and organize data locally using JSON and SessionStorage, provide and process authentication,
            and to perform calculations on large sets of data.

            <br/><br/>

            &emsp;Both the code and a video demo walkthrough are available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/zakariyasattar/Test-Lock" style="color: #f9bc60" target="_blank">Test-Lock</a>

            &emsp; Due to a brief stint in day-trading, I was able to gain some knowledge about markets and trading stocks. Given my computer science
            knowledge, what better way to merge these two fields than to write an algorithm that'll trade for me. At the time, I had just discovered
            Level II data, and I decided that using this data would be the best and simplest way to design the algorithm. Level II is a type of
            data that shows the current asks and bids of any given stock ticker, which is valuable information because for the most part, the market
            will move to execute asks and bids. The bigger the ask/bid, the more the market will move towards it. Given this info, it can be easy to predict
            the direction a stock will go; one needs to just find where the biggest order is. My algorithm would find the largest mover on the market for the day
            and collect all the bids and asks. With this data, the algorithm would perfom calculations to find out where the market was going to go, and make a
            purchase based on that data. The success rate was about 77%.

          <p class="project-text">
            <span style="float: right">
            &emsp; The Niles West Bus App first came into fruition as an idea proposal submitted to the App Development Club,
            of which I was the president. The problem was that the school buses would arrive in random spots every day, and there was only
            one security guard that knew the locations of all the buses. Every day hundreds of students
            would swamp this security guard asking where their bus was located. It was a big problem with an easy solution.
            It took me and another student a week before the project was completed, and the day we launched we logged over 350 page views.
            It was beautiful, to this day I've never worked on a project that has been so simple and has had such an impact on the
            daily lives of so many people. Once this program became an integral part of the school, I really began to understand the level of
            impact that was possible through my work as a Computer Scientist.</span>

          Congrats! You've passed the test and have located the Easter Egg. I'll reward you with a lovely story of my travels to Ethiopia.
          If you've made it this far, hopefully you have 5 more minutes. Thank you and get cozy!
