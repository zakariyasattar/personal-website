              So, who <i>is</i> Zakariya Sattar? Well, to start, I'm a second year Computer Science student at Michigan State
              University and so far, I've done some amazing things, like building out crazy personal projects, studying Arabic abroad
              in Jordan, and traveling the world (solo) to some insane destinations.
              <br/> <br/>

              I came into high school knowing exactly what I wanted to do. I enrolled in the highest AP
              computer science course I could find (even though I knew nothing about coding) and proceeded to do well,
              impress the professor, and be nominated for president of the App Development Club. Basically the story of my life:
              show up in places I don't belong and do better than everyone else. Sorry if that comes off too strong,
              but it's the truth 	&#128513;.
              <br/><br/>

              From there, it was onto Michigan State University, where I was there for a quick year, before I made the decision
              to spend a year in Jordan, studying Arabic. Thats a story for another time. On return to MSU I joined
              a Network Security Lab and began re-orienting myself with my earliest passion, Computer Science.

              Obviously theres <b> a lot </b> more to talk about, but I don't have enough
              space to talk about it here &#128529;. <a style="color: #7f5af0" href="mailto:zakariyasattar03@gmail.com">Email me</a>
              to schedule an interview.

            &emsp; Test-Lock began as an idea that I had when I noticed that most of the available testing applications
            were desktop applications and very tricky to use and navigate. I prided myself in the fact that Test-Lock
            was the <i>only</i> in-browser testing solution on the market at the time. I began working on Test-Lock in the summer
            after I got out of school, and after about 3 months, I had close to a finished product, just in time for the start of the new school year.
            This was a project that absolutely revolutionized my skill set. After this project, I came out with deep knowledge
            of working with JS and HTML to make dynamic webpages and with a brand new skills in database creation and management
            I was also forced to learn how to store and organize data locally using JSON and SessionStorage. Overall, this is the
            biggest project I've ever worked on, and while it never got used by any schools officially, I am beyond grateful for this
            opportunity because of how much I learned.

          <p class="project-text">
            <span style="float: right">&emsp; The Niles West Bus App first came into fruition as an idea proposal submitted to the App Development Club
            The problem was that the school busses would arrive in random spots every day, and there was only
            one person that new the locations of all the bus: the security guard. So, without fail, every day hundreds of students
            would swamp this security guard asking where their bus number was. Our app was an easy solution to a big problem.
            As the president of the App Development Club, I was tasked with the creation of the app. Within a week of the idea
            being presented to the club, another student and I had finished the app. It was beautiful, to this day I've never
            worked on a project that has been so simple and had such an impact on the daily lives of so many people. When
            this project was officially launched, I really began to understand the level of impact that was possible through my
            work as a Computer Scientist.</span>
